Several newspaper reports cited the character of Pennywise as an influence for the outbreak, which led to Stephen King commenting that people should lower hysteria caused by the sightings and not take his work seriously. The first reported sighting of people dressed as evil clowns was in Greenville, South Carolina, where a small boy spoke to his mother of a pair of clowns that had attempted to lure him away. After such an incident, hundreds of clowns had since been spotted in various American states including Florida, New York, Wisconsin, Kentucky, and subsequently in other Western countries, from August 2016.

Some explanations for the 2016 clown sightings phenomenon hypothesized that at least some of the sightings are part of a viral marketing campaign, possibly for the Rob Zombie movie 31 (2016). Greenville Police Chief Ken Miller claimed to reporters that investigators are unsure as to whether the sightings have any connection with 31 (2016), whether it was one or more people looking for \"kicks\", or something more sinister. A spokesperson for New Line Cinema (distributor of the 2017 movie adaptation) released a statement claiming that \"New Line is absolutely not involved in the rash of clown sightings.\" Reacting to the comparison, Stephen King stated \"I suspect it's a kind of low-level hysteria, like Slender Man, or the so-called Bunny Man, who purportedly lurked in Fairfax County, Virginia, wearing a white hood with long ears and attacking people with a hatchet or an axe.
